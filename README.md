## Dataset

The project utilizes the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) for training and testing the recommendation models. The dataset contains user ratings for a wide range of movies, which is used to create user-item interaction matrices.

## Key Features

- **Personalized Recommendations:** Provides tailored movie suggestions based on user preferences and historical data.
- **Multiple Recommendation Approaches:** Implements KNN, autoencoders, NCF, and transformer models to enhance recommendation accuracy.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluates model performance using precision and recall metrics, visualizing results for easy comparison.
- **User-friendly Interface:** (If applicable) Created a simple interface for users to interact with the recommendation system.

## Methodologies

1. **Data Processing:**
   - Loaded and cleaned the MovieLens dataset to create user-item interaction matrices.
   - Handled missing values and transformed the data to ensure compatibility with different models.

2. **Modeling Approaches:**
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Implemented KNN to identify similar users and items based on ratings, achieving baseline metrics of precision 0.5 and recall 0.1.
   - **Autoencoders:** Developed autoencoder models to learn user and item embeddings, capturing latent features and improving recommendation quality.
   - **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF):** Designed and trained an NCF model to capture complex interactions between users and items, enhancing recommendation accuracy.
   - **Transformer Model:** Leveraged transformer architectures to utilize attention mechanisms for improved modeling of user preferences.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - Assessed the performance of each model using precision and recall metrics.
   - Visualized the results using Matplotlib to compare the effectiveness of different methodologies and inform optimizations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vikramjeetsingh07/Movie-Recomendation-system-using-KNN-Autoencoders-NCF-transformers
   cd movie-recommendation-system

Usage
Load the dataset and preprocess it:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from your_preprocessing_module import preprocess_data

movies = pd.read_csv('data/movies.csv')
ratings = pd.read_csv('data/ratings.csv')
user_item_matrix = preprocess_data(movies, ratings)
Train and evaluate models:

python
Copy code
from your_model_module import train_knn_model, train_autoencoder_model, train_ncf_model, train_transformer_model

knn_model = train_knn_model(user_item_matrix)
autoencoder_model = train_autoencoder_model(user_item_matrix)
ncf_model = train_ncf_model(user_item_matrix)
transformer_model = train_transformer_model(user_item_matrix)
Generate recommendations:

python
Copy code
recommendations = knn_model.recommend(user_id)
Evaluation
The models are evaluated using precision and recall metrics. Results are visualized to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, leading to informed optimizations.
